* SQL
** Basic concepts
- A database has multiple tables
- A table has data entries arranged in rows and columns
- A field = A column
- A record = A row
- SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT
- Semicolon (;) is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server
  It's a good practice to always terminate a statement with a semicolon as it's described in ANSI SQL standards ( https://stackoverflow.com/a/710700 )
- The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.!

** Cartesian product
WHERE with multiple tables has the effect of cartesian product

The following example return |Orders| x |Customers| number of rows:
#+begin_src sql
-- https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_alias.asp
-- https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_alias_no
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Customers, Orders;
#+end_src

The following example only returns meaningful rows by conditioning on Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID :
#+begin_src sql
-- https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_alias.asp
-- https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_alias_no
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Customers, Orders
WHERE Customers.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID;
#+end_src

Therefore, the above code has the same effect with a query with (INNER) JOIN.
