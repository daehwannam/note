* SQL
** Basic concepts
   - A database has multiple tables
   - A table has data entries arranged in rows and columns
   - A field = A column
   - A record = A row
   - SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT
   - Semicolon (;) is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server
