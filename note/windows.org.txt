* Path setup
  - 컴퓨터 + 마우스 오른쪽 --> 고급 시스템 설정 --> 환경 변수 --> 시스템 변수: Path
  - all paths are connected via semi-colon(;)
  - former(left side) paths have more priorities than latter(right site) paths

* Linux utilities from git
  - Git for windows install useful binaries
    ex. C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin
  - the "bin" directory should be added to "Path" environment variable
  - then, linux commands can be used
    ex. ssh-keygen ssh-copy-id

* Emacs shortcut
  "emacs.exe" open two windows, so "runemacs.exe" should be used as shortcut instead.
  e.g. C:\Application\emacs-27.2-x86_64\bin\runemacs.exe

  For the consistent path without version, use the following path:
       C:\Application\emacs-27.2-x86_64\bin\runemacs.exe

* Environment variables for emacs
  - add "C:\Application\emacs-27.2-x86_64\bin" to PATH environment variable
  - add "C:\home" to HOME environment variable

* Startup folder
  - Windows + R --> shell:startup

* Disable Windows update
